# CNN-Traffic-sign-Classifier-deployed-webapp-with-audio-Streamlit-

In this Python project example,
we have build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories.
With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
And also we have made a webapp using streamlit
